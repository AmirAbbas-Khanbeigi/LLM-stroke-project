# LLM-stroke-project
this is a project to test if the combination of LLM and manifold learning can reveal anything important in biomedical data. 
we are at the moment testing it on a public data set "MIMIC IV". 
we have seen very promissing results in terms of cohort classification
we are at the moment testing a number of "intrinsic dimension estimators", or ID estimators.
