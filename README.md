# LLM-stroke-project
this is a project to test if the combination of LLM and manifold learning can reveal anything important in biomedical data. 
we are at the moment testing it on a public data set "MIMIC IV". 
we have seen very promissing results in terms of cohort classification. 
we are at the moment testing a number of "intrinsic dimension estimators", or ID estimators, including 2NN (two nearest neighbours) and MiND. We are focused on fractal dimension estimators but also check to see whether or not we can see the similar effects with simple dimension estimators such as PCA.
